## **Mission**

The Bitcoin District Initiative is a grassroots nonprofit dedicated to empowering Washington, DC residents and small businesses through education on Bitcoin. We meet people where they are, offering clear, practical resources to help them understand what Bitcoin is, why it matters as a tool for freedom and self-sovereignty, and how to navigate common misconceptions—so they can explore its potential with confidence and hope, especially for those seeking alternatives to traditional systems.

## **Purpose**

The Corporation is organized and operated exclusively for charitable and educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Specifically, its purpose is to advance public understanding of Bitcoin as a revolutionary peer-to-peer monetary network that promotes self-sovereignty, hope, and personal freedom for all who choose to learn about it.

In furtherance of this purpose, the Corporation will:

* Educate the public on Bitcoin's core principles, helping individuals and small businesses—particularly those underserved by traditional systems—gain awareness of its importance and avoid common misconceptions or pitfalls.  
* Provide resources and support to foster understanding and exploration of Bitcoin, focusing on its role in enabling personal empowerment and resilience through decentralized technology.  
* Partner with other nonprofits, community groups, and local organizations in the Washington, DC area to expand access to these educational efforts, ensuring broad community benefits and collaboration that strengthens neighborhoods and supports those seeking knowledge.

No part of the net earnings of the Corporation shall inure to the benefit of, or be distributable to, its directors, officers, or other private persons, except that the Corporation shall be authorized to pay reasonable compensation for services rendered and to make payments and distributions in furtherance of its exempt purposes. The Corporation shall not engage in substantial lobbying or political campaign activities, and all activities shall comply with applicable laws governing 501(c)(3) organizations. The Corporation does not provide financial, tax, or investment advice.

## **Activities**

To achieve its mission and purpose, the Bitcoin District Initiative will engage in the following primary activities, all designed to serve the public interest through education and community support:

**Educational Workshops and Seminars:** Host free or low-cost in-person and online sessions in Washington, DC, teaching Bitcoin basics, its decentralized principles, and its significance for personal freedom. We'll meet participants at their level—whether they're new to the concept or curious explorers—helping them grasp why Bitcoin deserves attention and how to spot common misconceptions.

**Community Meetups and Events:** Organize regular gatherings, mentorship programs, and local collaborations to build a supportive network of Bitcoin learners. By partnering with other nonprofits (like community centers, educational groups, or local associations), we'll amplify our reach, connecting with diverse groups across the District to share knowledge and encourage informed exploration.

**Resource Development and Distribution:** Create and freely share practical guides, tools, and materials on understanding Bitcoin's technology and its broader implications. This includes simple resources that highlight its role as a peer-to-peer network, encouraging awareness of its potential for self-sovereignty without falling for hype or misinformation.

**Outreach and Partnerships:** Work hand-in-hand with schools, small businesses, and community organizations to bring Bitcoin education to varied audiences. We'll focus on those curious about alternatives to centralized systems, offering hands-on learning to help them understand Bitcoin's importance, while collaborating with aligned nonprofits to extend our impact citywide.

**Public Awareness Initiatives:** Produce and distribute educational content (e.g., articles, videos, podcasts) that explains what Bitcoin is and why it matters as sound, decentralized money. We'll emphasize principled learning, promoting critical thinking to help people pay attention to Bitcoin's true value amid surrounding distractions.

These activities will be conducted with humility and a focus on public service, ensuring they primarily advance education and charitable goals without serving private interests. We'll track and report on them annually in our Form 990 to show ongoing compliance. The Corporation does not provide financial, tax, or investment advice.
