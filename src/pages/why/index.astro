While the U.S. dollar loses purchasing power every year, Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it scarce, durable, and deflationary. Over time, each satoshi you save represents a growing claim on global value, not a shrinking one."

Just as miners extract gold from the earth, Bitcoin miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to secure the network and release new bitcoins. Unlike gold, we know exactly how many will ever exist: 21 million. This scarcity makes Bitcoin uniquely valuable in a world where traditional currencies can be printed without limit.",
