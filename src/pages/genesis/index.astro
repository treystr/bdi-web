                        It began with a few Bitcoiners meeting in Washington, DC — talking, learning, and imagining what it would look like if people actually used Bitcoin in everyday life. What started as casual meetups grew into a movement to build something real: a circular economy born from the community, not imposed from above.

                        We realized that adoption only lasts when it grows organically — through trust, education, and local connection. So we set out to be the change we wanted to see, helping neighbors and small businesses discover how Bitcoin can strengthen independence and economic freedom right here in the Nation's Capital.

                        This page honors those first supporters—the Genesis Donors—who believed in the mission before it had momentum, before there were results to show. They helped us take the first step. Now, we invite you to join them.
