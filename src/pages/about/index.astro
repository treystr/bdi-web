                We're building a grassroots Bitcoin circular economy in the Nation's Capital. As a 501(c)(3) public charity, the Bitcoin District Initiative advances real-world Bitcoin adoption in Washington, DC and beyond. We help local businesses accept Bitcoin, educate residents through hands-on workshops and meetups, and partner with like-minded groups to grow Bitcoin-based economic networks across the country. Led by volunteers and rooted in transparency and open-source principles, we're laying the foundation for economic freedom and personal sovereignty from the ground up.

                The Bitcoin District Initiative grew out of the local Bitcoin District Meetup, a community of friends, builders, and learners united by a shared curiosity and passion for Bitcoin. While the meetup continues to thrive on its own, the Initiative exists to support and grow that ecosystem, bringing more good people into the conversation and strengthening DC's Bitcoin community.
