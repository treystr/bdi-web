                Build a grassroots Bitcoin Circular Economy in the Nation's Capital. The Bitcoin District Initiative is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit public charity advancing grassroots Bitcoin adoption in Washington, DC and beyond. Our objectives are to support local business adoption and foster circular Bitcoin economies, educate residents and communities through accessible workshops and meetups, and partner with other local initiatives to expand sustainable, Bitcoin-based economic networks nationwide. Guided by a volunteer board and rooted in transparency and open-source principles, we're building a foundation for real-world Bitcoin use that strengthens economic freedom and personal sovereignty from the ground up.

                The Bitcoin District Initiative was born out of the local Bitcoin District Meetup—a community of friends, builders, and learners united by a shared curiosity and passion for Bitcoin. While the meetup continues to thrive on its own, the Initiative exists to support and grow that ecosystem, helping bring more good people into the conversation and strengthening DC's Bitcoin community.
