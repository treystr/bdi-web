                We're building a principled, grassroots community of Bitcoiners right here in the DMV. The <strong>Bitcoin District Initiative</strong> is powered by volunteers, educators, and advocates who believe in Bitcoin's promise of economic freedom, monetary sovereignty, and personal empowerment. If you're passionate about Bitcoin and want to help us grow through education, outreach, or community building, we invite you to join our mission. Together, we can make Washington, DC a leading hub for sound money and grassroots adoption.
