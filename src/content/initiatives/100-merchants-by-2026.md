# 100 Merchants by 2026

The Bitcoin District Initiative is launching Initiative 2026 — a bold, grassroots effort to onboard 100 local businesses across the DMV to Bitcoin by the end of 2026. From cafés and farmers markets to barbershops and bakeries, we’re helping neighborhood merchants accept and hold Bitcoin as both a payment tool and a path to financial sovereignty.

Our mission is to turn Washington, DC into a model Bitcoin Circular Economy — a living example of how freedom technology can thrive in the heart of the nation’s capital. When visitors arrive, they’ll find a city where they can spend Bitcoin freely, and where local entrepreneurs are empowered to save in a currency that can’t be inflated away.

Each onboarding represents more than a transaction — it’s a small act of resilience in an era of uncertainty. By equipping Main Street businesses with open-source tools and hands-on education, we’re proving that economic independence can start one merchant, one neighborhood, and one block at a time.

Join us in building a city that shows the world what financial sovereignty looks like — in practice, not just in theory.
