# Local Business Survey

## Overview  

The **Local Business Survey** is a grassroots effort to understand what small, independent businesses in DC think about Bitcoin — from farmers market stands to single-owner shops.

The survey also makes it easy to **start real conversations**. Instead of leading with Bitcoin, it gives us a reason to stop by, ask good questions, and learn how local businesses actually operate. It’s about building trust and listening — not pitching.  

Every survey response is collected in-person at farmers' markets or just by going door-to-door around the district.

## Goals  

1. **Spark Genuine Conversations** – Use the survey as a friendly way to engage local business owners and learn about their real challenges.  
2. **Understand Local Needs** – Identify pain points in payments and savings, like high fees or delayed payouts.  
3. **Evaluate Barriers to Adoption** – Learn what’s holding people back — whether technical, cultural, or practical.  
4. **Measure Awareness and Tailor Educational Programs** – Gauge familiarity with Bitcoin and shape future outreach around what businesses actually need.
