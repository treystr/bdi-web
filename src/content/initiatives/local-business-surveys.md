# Local Business Survey

## Overview

Our **Local Business Survey** is a grassroots research effort designed to better understand the challenges local businesses in Washington, DC face with payments, savings, and technology. By listening directly to local businesses, we aim to identify where Bitcoin can make the most meaningful impact — from lowering fees and reducing fraud to creating new opportunities for economic freedom.

This initiative also serves as an **entry point for conversation**. We’ve found that it can sometimes be awkward to walk into a business and start talking about Bitcoin right away. The survey helps break the ice — giving us a natural way to listen first, learn about each business’s real-world challenges, and start a thoughtful discussion about how Bitcoin might fit into their goals. It’s about building trust, not making a pitch.

Through this effort, we're gathering insights that will help guide educational programs, workshops, and hands-on local business onboarding across the District. Our goal is to meet business owners where they are, learn from their experiences, and build tools and resources that make Bitcoin adoption simple, secure, and empowering.

## Goals

1. **Start Meaningful Conversations**  
   Use the survey as a bridge to open authentic discussions with local business owners — listening to their challenges before introducing Bitcoin as a potential solution.

2. **Understand Local Business Needs**  
   Identify the most common challenges DC local businesses face with customer payments — such as high fees, delayed payouts, or chargebacks.

3. **Measure Awareness and Familiarity**  
   Assess how well business owners currently understand Bitcoin, from basic awareness to active use or interest in accepting it as payment.

4. **Evaluate Barriers to Adoption**  
   Learn what's holding local businesses back — whether it's technical uncertainty, lack of demand, or the need for practical training.

5. **Guide Educational Outreach**  
   Use the results to design targeted workshops, one-on-one trainings, and community meetups that make Bitcoin adoption approachable and beneficial for local businesses.

6. **Support a Thriving Local Bitcoin Economy**  
   Help establish a real-world Bitcoin circular economy in Washington, DC — one built on trust, local connections, and sound money principles.
