**Washington, DC, December 1, 2025** — Bitcoin District Initiative (BDI), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit building a grassroots Bitcoin circular economy in the DC area, has officially launched to help small businesses in the District adopt Bitcoin, grow the local community, and strengthen local economic freedom.

Born from the Bitcoin District community, the Initiative will focus on education, merchant onboarding, and community connection. Its first target is to help 21 local businesses accept Bitcoin by the end of 2025, on the way to 100 by the end of 2026. To support this work, the Initiative will make use of Square's recent integration of Bitcoin within its payments suite.

## Partnership with PubKey

The Initiative is partnering with PubKey, the renowned Bitcoin bar from NYC, which is now opening in Downtown DC. The partnership aims at creating a community education hub where workshops and meetups will enrich DC's diverse cultural and small-business communities.

"We're meeting shopkeepers and neighbors across the District to show how simple Bitcoin can be in everyday life. Every conversation moves DC closer to a working circular economy," said Trey Musgrave, president of the Bitcoin District Initiative. "Visitors will see what's possible here and bring that model back to their own communities."

BDI is kicking off thanks to its initial donors and volunteers—locals who provided early funding and helped turn the city's grassroots Bitcoin energy into a formal nonprofit effort.

## Survey Insights

The Initiative also ran a citywide survey to start conversations with local businesses and learn how they view Bitcoin. The report will be published soon. Early insights include:

- Nearly 90% of Food & Grocery businesses reported high processor fees as their biggest challenge.
- 69% of surveyed businesses never thought of Bitcoin as a payment option.
- The Food & Drink industry has been the most open and receptive, with over 70% of surveyed businesses interested in follow-up.

## Quotes from Local Businesses

**Michael Haft, Founder and CEO at Compass Coffee:** "At Compass, we've always believed in doing things the right way—even if it means being early. That's why we've been advocates for Bitcoin for years. The tech is mature. The tooling is clean. The incentives line up. Now, with Square making it easier than ever, there's really no excuse not to accept Bitcoin. Lower fees, faster settlement, and full transparency—this is the future of payments. We're proud to support Bitcoin and even prouder to see friends in the community helping other businesses do the same."

**Dan Kablaoui, Chief Operating Officer at PubKey:** "The Bitcoin community is among the most highly skilled, highly motivated, and deeply supportive group of people in the world. Everywhere PubKey goes, we encounter S tier friends and allies. Bitcoin District Initiative is no different. We're eager to get our local content engine revved up in DC working with their team and the rest of the local community here."

**Eric Pimenta, Growth and Community Marketing at PubKey:** "I came from the New York Bitcoin scene, and one of my goals here in D.C. has been to help grow the local community. Over the past few months, I've spent time with the BDI team ahead of PubKey D.C.'s launch and we're excited to take local Bitcoin events to the next level together. PubKey will become the home base for D.C.'s Bitcoin meetups and open, public programming."

**Stephen Neill, Father of Kidpreneur Asher Neill the Founder of District Lemonade:** "My son and 'Kidpreneur' Asher founded District Lemonade back in 2024. At the time he was just learning how to count by 5's as well as identifying his currency. One year later Trey comes along with Bitcoin and now the small lemonade stand in DuPont Circle takes tap and Bitcoin. My 6 yr old has dreams of scaling his business and often he brags to his classmates that he now owns Bitcoin. Thanks for bringing that world of digital currency to my kids as well as myself!"

**Aleksa Cepic, Owner of The Big Chef:** "It's all about connection. Through food, through conversation, and now through Bitcoin—it's another way to bring people together."

**Nessar, owner of Cafe U:** "Cafe U is proud to begin accepting Bitcoin as part of our commitment to innovation and accessibility. Thank you to the Bitcoin District Initiative for the support in making this happen."
