**Washington, DC, November 21, 2025** — The Bitcoin District Initiative received prominent recognition in a Forbes article covering the opening of PubKey's second location in downtown Washington, DC. The piece, written by Frank Corva, highlighted the growing Bitcoin community in the DMV area and specifically called out BDI's work building a circular economy in the nation's capital.

In the article, Dan Kablaoui, Chief Operating Officer at PubKey, spoke about the enthusiastic Bitcoin community in the DC, Maryland, and Virginia region. He emphasized the serious commitment of local Bitcoin advocates and their efforts to create a thriving Bitcoin economy.

"They're serious people, and they're turning this city into a bitcoin circular economy," Kablaoui told Forbes. "One of these guys, Trey, started a new nonprofit called the Bitcoin District Initiative, and he's onboarding four or five vendors a week to bitcoin."

This recognition comes as BDI continues its mission to help local businesses adopt Bitcoin and build a sustainable circular economy where Bitcoin stays within the community. The organization's rapid merchant onboarding pace—four to five vendors per week—demonstrates the strong demand from DC-area businesses looking to accept Bitcoin payments.

The Forbes article also highlighted PubKey's new 12,000 square-foot DC location, which will serve as both a Bitcoin bar and the new home base for the Bitcoin Policy Institute. The venue features two bars, a stage for fireside chats and live music, a podcast studio, and space for community events—all designed to support the growing Bitcoin community in the nation's capital.

BDI's partnership with PubKey has been instrumental in creating educational opportunities and community meetups that help businesses understand the benefits of accepting Bitcoin. The recognition in Forbes underscores the momentum building in DC's Bitcoin ecosystem and validates the organization's grassroots approach to merchant adoption.

The article noted that the local Bitcoin community in the DMV area is "a totally different breed" of serious advocates who are actively working to transform the city into a Bitcoin-friendly economic hub. This aligns with BDI's mission to provide accessible education and resources that empower individuals and businesses to participate in the Bitcoin economy.

As BDI continues to onboard merchants and build community, this recognition from a major publication like Forbes helps raise awareness of the organization's work and the broader movement toward Bitcoin adoption in Washington, DC.
