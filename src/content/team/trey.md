Trey Musgrave is the founder of the **Bitcoin District Initiative**, where he leads efforts to make Washington, DC a thriving hub for grassroots Bitcoin education and adoption. After a 15-year career in the professional world, Trey left his previous path to dedicate himself fully to advancing Bitcoin as sound, decentralized money.  

A passionate community builder, Trey focuses on connecting with everyday people, small businesses, and local organizations to share how Bitcoin addresses real-world challenges and offers a path toward **economic freedom and personal sovereignty**. His approach is grounded in building relationships, fostering understanding, and empowering others through education.  

Trey also collaborates with other Bitcoin builders at the [Strategy Hub](https://strategy.com/hub), where he contributes to a growing ecosystem of open-source innovation. Guided by humility and long-term vision, Trey embodies the Initiativeâ€™s ethos: *work hard, stay humble, and help others see the change Bitcoin can bring to the world.*
