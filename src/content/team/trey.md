My name is Trey and I'm a passionate Bitcoiner in Washington, DC. I left my career of 15 years to launch the Bitcoin District Initiative. I love building relationships with everyday people and teaching them about the problems that Bitcoin is solving in the world.

I am also fortunate to work out of the [Strategy Hub](https://strategy.com/hub) a few days a week with others who are building businesses on Bitcoin.

Be the change you want to see in the world.
