Bhavna Patel brings over two decades of leadership in policy, strategy, and nonprofit development. With a career spanning local government, international development, and community service, she has consistently worked at the intersection of public service and systems reform, building programs that improve lives while strengthening institutions.

As CEO of Elevation Advisors, Bhavna supports nonprofits and mission-driven organizations through strategic advisory and educational initiatives. She previously served as a Senior Policy Advisor at USAID and the U.S. Department of State, where she directed multi-million-dollar programs in health systems, financial reform, and digital services across Europe, Eurasia, and emerging markets. Her work included building coalitions with lawmakers, international partners, and technical experts to expand access to resilient public systems and innovative technologies. Earlier in her career, she served as a Field Office Director with Catholic Relief Services, leading humanitarian and development programs across Asia and the Balkans.  

In addition to her professional work, Bhavna has deep roots in community leadership. She was elected as a Commissioner for DC’s Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2B, representing more than 2,000 constituents and advancing community priorities in education, safety, and urban development. She has also contributed to the Suffragist Education Institute, helping to shape national educational efforts around women’s history.  

At the Bitcoin District Initiative, Bhavna draws on her nonprofit leadership and policy expertise to strengthen our educational and outreach programs. She is passionate about making Bitcoin accessible to policymakers, communities, and organizations as a tool for **economic freedom, monetary sovereignty, and personal empowerment**. Her experience bridging grassroots initiatives with high-level policy makes her a valuable guide as we build a principled, community-driven Bitcoin hub in Washington, DC.
