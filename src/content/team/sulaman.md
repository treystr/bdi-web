Sulaman Shah is a dedicated volunteer with the **Bitcoin District Initiative**, where he contributes to advancing grassroots Bitcoin education and adoption. As the founder and CEO of Terrapin Crypto Solutions, LLC, Sulaman leads work on Bitcoin infrastructure powered by renewable energy, with a focus on hydropower and sustainable practices. His efforts highlight how Bitcoin mining can align with responsible energy use while strengthening decentralized networks.

With a background in Environmental Science and Biological Research, Sulaman previously worked with the USDA and U.S. Department of the Interior, conducting honey bee research and developing GIS systems. He brings this scientific perspective to his current work, exploring Bitcoin’s relationship with ecological systems and how open-source technologies can promote resilience in communities.

Beyond his professional contributions, Sulaman advises policymakers at the state and federal level on Bitcoin and decentralized technologies, and he collaborates with projects like Bitcoin Timber and Carbon Country to integrate ecological awareness into mining operations. He has also researched Bitcoin’s relevance in Islamic economic traditions and its role in strengthening communities affected by conflict.

An Eagle Scout with Vigil Honor and fluent in French, Sulaman brings a global outlook and a commitment to service. He regularly participates in events such as Mining Disrupt, the Bitcoin Conference, and DC-area meetups, helping to foster community, share knowledge, and encourage principled adoption. At the Initiative, Sulaman supports educational programs that empower individuals to embrace Bitcoin as a tool for **economic freedom, monetary sovereignty, and personal empowerment**.
