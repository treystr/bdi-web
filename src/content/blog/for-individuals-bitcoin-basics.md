## Securing Your Coins

You don't have to trust an exchange with your Bitcoin. When you're ready, you can take full custody of your own coins for long-term safe keeping.

> **⚠️ NEVER NEVER NEVER** give your seed phrase to anyone or type it into any internet-connected device. Your seed phrase is the key to your Bitcoin and if exposed, you could lose all of your Bitcoin.
