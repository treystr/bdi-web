## Key Questions and Answers

### How is Bitcoin treated for tax purposes in the U.S.?

The IRS classifies Bitcoin as property, not currency. This means every sale, payment, or exchange can trigger a capital gain or loss. There are no taxes for simply holding Bitcoin after it is acquired.

### If my business accepts Bitcoin as payment, what are the tax implications?

The payment is recognized as ordinary income at its fair market value (USD spot price) on the date/time of receipt. That amount becomes your sales revenue. Bitcoin's price action after the date of that transaction does not affect that sales revenue figure as it is already established by the original date of the transaction.

### Do I owe taxes if I hold the Bitcoin after receiving it?

Your business does not owe taxes for simply holding Bitcoin as an asset under the business. However, if you later sell, trade, or spend Bitcoin, you will realize a capital gain or loss based on the difference between your cost basis (the original USD value when received) and the sale price.

### What happens if I hold Bitcoin instead of converting it to dollars? Does this reduce my tax burden?

You are required to pay taxes on all Bitcoin payments that come to the business in the form of revenue through a transaction or customer payment. After these payments have been properly accounted for, your business may choose to hold the Bitcoin without converting it to USD. If you do this, this will delay any capital gains or losses until the business chooses to sell, trade, or exchange the Bitcoin. However, once the Bitcoin is used in a transaction or converted into USD, this triggers a taxable capital gain or loss, depending on Bitcoin's price action.

### What records should I keep for Bitcoin transactions?

Keep detailed logs showing the date, USD value at the time of each transaction, purpose (payment, sale, etc.), and wallet or exchange used. Automated tracking tools make this easier, but the most important figure to track is your cost basis for each transaction.

### How do sales taxes apply to Bitcoin transactions?

Sales tax rules apply the same as with cash payments—receiving a payment in Bitcoin makes no difference here. To put it another way, the fact that the customer pays in Bitcoin doesn't change your obligation to collect and remit sales tax on taxable goods or services.

### How do I report Bitcoin on my business tax return?

Report revenue in U.S. dollars at the fair market value on the date received. Any gains or losses from later conversions or spending are reported separately as capital gains if the Bitcoin has been sold, exchanged, or traded since the initial acquisition from the payment. The type of business entity (C-corp, S-corp, partnership, etc.) will affect which tax form the capital gain gets reflected on and the specific tax treatment.

### Can I pay employees or contractors in Bitcoin?

Yes, but those payments are treated as wages or compensation at the USD equivalent value on the payment date, subject to payroll reporting and withholding requirements. This would also trigger a capital gains or loss event because it is a transfer of Bitcoin out of the business to the employee.

### What about volatility? How should I handle accounting for Bitcoin price changes?

Businesses may revalue holdings for financial reporting—talk to an accounting professional if you have questions about this for your business. However, for tax purposes, unrealized gains or losses aren't recognized until the Bitcoin is sold, spent, or exchanged.

### Is there anything I can do to streamline or simplify the process?

Use accounting software or integrations built for Bitcoin transactions that automatically convert prices, track basis, and post journal entries. You can find several Bitcoin accounting and invoicing services at [bitcoinproducts.com/accounting](https://www.bitcoinproducts.com/accounting).

Also, if you work with a CPA to help with your books and your tax preparation, before year-end, ask your CPA three key questions:

- How should I track and report my Bitcoin transactions for 2025 taxes?
- Are there opportunities to reduce taxable gains or improve recordkeeping now?
- What's the best accounting method or software for Bitcoin payments in my business?

You'll also want to understand how payment processors like Square handle Bitcoin sales. Often you can set bitcoin sales to automatically convert Bitcoin to U.S. dollars at the spot price upon receipt, meaning your business only is recording the USD received.
