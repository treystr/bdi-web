This guide provides a short script for introducing local business owners to Bitcoin payments. Square now allows merchants to accept Bitcoin directly through the app they already use.

This approach focuses on what matters to merchants: saving money, serving more customers, and using tools they already trust.

## Purpose

This script is for customers who want to help local shops start accepting Bitcoin. It is a simple way to suggest a tool that saves them money and attracts new customers.

## Subject: Square's New Payment Method

> **Hi [Name],**
>
> I noticed you were a Square seller and wanted to ask if you would consider setting up a new payment method that lets customers like me pay with Bitcoin.
> 
> Square recently added native Bitcoin support to their app, and you can enable it in settings without any new hardware. Even if you do not want to hold any Bitcoin with your business, you can configure these payments to settle only in USD and still benefit from:
>
> * Zero processing fees (until at least 2027)
> * Near-instant settlement
> * No chargeback risk
> 
> I live in [your city] and love your shop. If you are interested, I would be happy to show you how the feature works or help you run a test transaction. I can also help get you listed on BTCmap.org and introduce you to the local Bitcoin community to bring more customers your way.
> 
> Let me know if you would like to chat about getting it started.

## Tips for Success

**Keep it personal**
Mention if you are a regular customer. This shows you are supporting their business.

**Be brief**
Business owners are busy. Keep your message short and to the point.

**Highlight the savings**
Zero fees until 2027 is the most important part for most merchants.

**Follow up in person**
If you visit the shop, mention the email. A friendly face makes the suggestion more real.

## Resources

If they want to learn more, you can offer these:

* **Setup support:** Help them find the toggle in their Square settings.
* **Signage:** Mention "Bitcoin Accepted Here" stickers or signs.
* **Directory listings:** Offer to help list their business on Bitcoin maps.

## Final Note

The goal is to help local businesses save on fees and connect with more customers. By using tools they already trust, they can explore Bitcoin with no added risk.
