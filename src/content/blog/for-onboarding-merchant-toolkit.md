## The Art of Merchant Onboarding

Successfully onboarding merchants to Bitcoin requires a combination of technical knowledge, people skills, and patience. This toolkit provides everything you need to help local businesses start accepting Bitcoin.

Before visiting a merchant, prepare your devices, educational materials, and marketing materials. During the conversation, emphasize cost savings, lack of chargebacks, and access to the Bitcoin community. Address common objections with empathy and clear information.

Ready to help bring Bitcoin to Main Street DC? Contact the Bitcoin District Initiative to join our volunteer onboarding team. Together, we're building a circular Bitcoin economy in the nation's capital.
