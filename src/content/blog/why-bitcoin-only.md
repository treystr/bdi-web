## Why We’re a Bitcoin-Only Nonprofit

At the **Bitcoin District Initiative**, we focus on one thing — and we do it with purpose.

We’re a **Bitcoin-only nonprofit** because Bitcoin is not just another “crypto project.” It’s the only open, decentralized, and truly permissionless monetary network that serves humanity without discrimination, middlemen, or gatekeepers.

Everything else — every token, platform, or centralized blockchain — tries to repackage old power structures in new language. Bitcoin stands apart because it has **no founder to bribe, no company to control, and no marketing team to sell you promises**. It was released as open-source code, owned by no one and available to everyone.

Bitcoin didn’t raise venture capital. It didn’t rely on influencers or pre-mines. It was discovered, not invented — and in that discovery lies its purity. It’s money that’s earned, not issued. **Rules, not rulers.**

## Why This Matters for Our Mission

Our mission is to **build a grassroots Bitcoin circular economy in Washington, DC** — one business, one neighborhood, one block at a time.

To stay true to that mission, we must stand on principles that cannot be co-opted or corrupted. Bitcoin alone offers:

- **Self-custody** — the ability to hold your own value without permission or counterparty risk.  
- **Open access** — no accounts, no forms, no discrimination. If you have an internet connection, you can participate.  
- **Digital scarcity** — a fixed supply that cannot be inflated or manipulated by anyone, anywhere.  
- **Censorship resistance** — a global network that doesn’t bend to politics, policy, or profit motives.  

These are not just technical features; they are **human rights** — essential to economic freedom and personal sovereignty.

## The Difference Between Bitcoin and “Crypto”

Bitcoin is **freedom money**. “Crypto” is **speculation**.

Bitcoin is transparent, voluntary, and incorruptible. “Crypto” is full of opaque governance, insider allocations, and endless reinvention of trust-based systems that Bitcoin already replaced.

At the Bitcoin District Initiative, we’re not here to gamble. We’re here to **build** — a resilient, open, and inclusive economy grounded in truth, not trends.

## One Mission, One Protocol

We believe education should be simple, honest, and effective.  
That’s why every workshop, every partnership, and every donation we receive is rooted in **Bitcoin only**. It’s the protocol that best reflects our values: transparency, self-sovereignty, and open access for all.

Because when you strip away the noise, there’s only one digital system that’s truly decentralized, truly scarce, and truly for the people.

That’s Bitcoin.  
That’s why we’re **Bitcoin Only**.
