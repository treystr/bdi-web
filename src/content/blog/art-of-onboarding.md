## Building the Bitcoin Circular Economy, One Conversation at a Time

Convincing a business to accept Bitcoin isn’t an event—it’s a process.  
It happens one conversation, one question, and one small act of curiosity at a time.  

If you’re part of a local Bitcoin community—especially here in Washington, DC—helping businesses understand Bitcoin isn’t about persuasion. It’s about education, respect, and meeting people where they are.

## 1. Low Time Preference Applies Here

When onboarding businesses, think in terms of **low time preference**—the same mindset that guides Bitcoiners in saving and building for the long term.  
You’re not trying to “convert” anyone overnight. You’re planting seeds. Some take weeks or months to grow.  

A single friendly conversation can set the stage for a business to reach out months later when they’re ready to explore.


## 2. Don’t Be Pushy—Respect Their Pace

Every business owner has a unique background, worldview, and set of priorities.  
Some might be curious about Bitcoin; others might be skeptical or just too busy to think about it.  

Respect their time, experience, and perspective. Your goal isn’t to win an argument—it’s to build trust.


## 3. Be Prepared (and Honest When You Don’t Know)

You don’t need to have every technical answer.  
But being generally knowledgeable about Bitcoin payments—especially practical solutions like Square or OpenNode—goes a long way.  

If a question stumps you, that’s perfectly OK.  
**Write it down** and share it with your local Bitcoin community so others can help you learn. The more we share, the better prepared we all become.

## 4. Make It Easy to Get Started

For most businesses, simplicity is everything.  
If they’re already using Square or another familiar point-of-sale system, highlight how easy it is to start accepting Bitcoin—often in under two minutes.  

Jumping straight to self-custody or node setup can be intimidating. Start with what’s familiar, and let curiosity grow from there.  
When they’re ready to explore deeper, you can help them take the next step—maybe at a workshop or local meetup.


## 5. Bring “Bitcoin Accepted Here” Signs

A tangible reminder can spark curiosity and conversation with customers.  
Keep a few small signs or stickers handy in different sizes.  
Some shops may want a subtle counter display, while others will proudly place one near the entrance.  

A well-placed sign tells customers: *we’re part of something bigger.*


## 6. Keep It Friendly, Simple, and Grounded

Avoid overloading people with technical jargon or philosophical rabbit holes.  
Stick to clear, relatable explanations:  
> “Bitcoin is better money.”  
> “It’s like digital gold, except there will only ever be so much of it.”  

Keep the conversation real, not speculative.


## 7. Everyone’s on Their Own Path

Some business owners will dive in quickly. Others may take years.  
Remember: Bitcoin adoption is a journey, not a conversion campaign.  
Lead with humility and patience—just as others once did for you.


## Say This, Not That

| ✅ **Say This** | 🚫 **Don’t Say This** |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| “Bitcoin is better money—like digital gold.” | “Bitcoin is going to the moon.” |
| “Bitcoin lets you accept payments instantly with no chargebacks.” | “Bitcoin is going to replace banks.” |
| “You can accept Bitcoin and still convert to dollars automatically.” | “You have to go all-in on Bitcoin.” |
| “Bitcoin is money that can’t be inflated.” | “End the Fed.” |
| “Square lets you start accepting Bitcoin in minutes.” | “You need to run a full node and use cold storage.” |


## 8. Share What You Learn

Every interaction helps the next.  
Take note of what business owners ask—those questions reveal what the community needs to explain better.  
Share that feedback at your next meetup or with your local Initiative chapter.  

When we learn together, **we onboard together**.


## Closing Thoughts

Talking to businesses about Bitcoin isn’t about selling a product—it’s about **showing what sound money looks like in practice**.  

With patience, kindness, and preparation, every Bitcoiner can help build the circular economy—one conversation, one register, one small business at a time.
