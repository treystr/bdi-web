## Welcome to Your Bitcoin Journey

New to Bitcoin? You’re in the right place.  
This page gathers resources to help you understand what Bitcoin is, why it exists, and how to start using it.

Take your time — learning Bitcoin isn’t a race.  
The best thing you can do is **start learning** and **focus on Bitcoin**. Avoid distractions from other coins or projects that promise more. Bitcoin is where the real learning begins.

Here are some of the best videos to start with. They explain the basics of money, why Bitcoin was created, and what makes it unique.

## Buying Your First Bitcoin

Once you understand the basics, you can use a **Bitcoin-only exchange** to buy your first sats (small pieces of Bitcoin).  
These platforms focus only on Bitcoin — no tokens, no distractions.

> **Note:** These are custodial exchanges, meaning they hold your Bitcoin until you withdraw it.  
> When you’re ready, learn how to take full custody of your Bitcoin below.

**[River](https://river.com)** — Bitcoin-only, Proof of Reserves, zero-fee recurring orders, strong security and support.  
**[Strike](https://strike.me)** — Bitcoin-only, global reach, free withdrawals, bill pay, paycheck conversion.  
**[CashApp](https://cash.app)** — Bitcoin-only, simple to use, round-up purchases, widely adopted mobile app.


## Securing Your Bitcoin

When you’re ready, take your Bitcoin off an exchange and hold it yourself.  
This is called **self-custody**, and it’s how you actually own your Bitcoin.

> **⚠️ Never share your seed phrase** with anyone or enter it into any website or app. Your seed phrase controls your Bitcoin. If someone gets it, they can take your funds.
