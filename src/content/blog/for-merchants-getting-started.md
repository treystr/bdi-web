## Why Accept Bitcoin?

Accepting Bitcoin as a payment method offers several advantages for your business: lower transaction fees, no chargebacks, global reach, and financial sovereignty. When you accept Bitcoin, you're also tapping into a growing community of customers who prefer to spend their Bitcoin locally.

## Getting Started

The process of accepting Bitcoin is simpler than you might think. Choose a wallet solution, generate payment addresses, train your staff, and display your acceptance with signage. The Bitcoin District Initiative is here to help DC-area merchants through every step of the onboarding process.

Contact us to schedule a free consultation and start accepting Bitcoin today.
