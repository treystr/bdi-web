## A Major Step for Bitcoin Payments

Square’s latest Bitcoin update marks a turning point for small businesses. For the first time, merchants using Square can now accept **Bitcoin payments over the Lightning Network** with no extra setup and—most importantly—**no transaction fees through 2027**.

This change isn’t just about convenience. It’s about giving businesses the freedom to transact directly, globally, and instantly—with or without relying on banks or payment processors.

## Key Features That Matter

### **1. Zero Fees (Through 2027)**
Square is waiving all Bitcoin transaction fees until at least 2027. That means merchants can receive payments instantly over Lightning without paying card or processing fees—keeping more of what they earn.

### **2. Open Payments: Any Lightning Wallet Works**
Customers can pay from *any* Lightning wallet, not just Square’s. This open approach avoids vendor lock-in and keeps Bitcoin payments interoperable and free. Whether it’s Phoenix, Muun, Blink, or Breez—your customers can use the wallet they already trust.

### **3. Full Control Over Conversion**
Merchants can choose to automatically convert 100% of their Bitcoin sales into dollars, protecting against price volatility while still accepting Bitcoin. This helps businesses onboard without risk or accounting complexity.

### **4. Option to Save in Bitcoin**
Sellers can now choose to automatically save **up to 50% of their dollar sales in Bitcoin** with a simple toggle inside Square’s dashboard. Square charges a 1% conversion fee for this option—giving businesses an easy, compliant way to start holding Bitcoin as savings.

## Why This Matters for the Bitcoin Circular Economy

Paying with Bitcoin isn’t new — but **how easy Square just made it is**.  

What’s changed is that a neighborhood business can now turn on Bitcoin payments in minutes, right inside the same Square app they already use for credit cards and cash. There’s no new hardware, no extra setup, no friction. I set up the Lightning wallet in about **two minutes**, and it ran seamlessly alongside the same systems millions of businesses have trusted for years.

This update finally closes the gap between **convenience and sovereignty**. Merchants can now accept Bitcoin payments as easily as swiping a card — but without the fees, chargebacks, or middlemen.  

That means more local shops can participate in a **true Bitcoin circular economy**—spending, saving, and earning in sound money, without needing permission from banks or payment processors.

For communities like **the Bitcoin District in Washington, DC**, this change is a huge step forward. It supports our mission to help local businesses adopt Bitcoin in practical, privacy-respecting ways that reduce costs, build resilience, and strengthen the local economy.
