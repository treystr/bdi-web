## A Major Step for Bitcoin Payments

Square's latest Bitcoin update marks a major turning point for millions of businesses across the country. For the first time, Square sellers can now accept **Bitcoin** natively across the entire Square POS ecosystem. Businesses have 2 options with respect to the Bitcoin paid by their customers:

  1. Hold all the Bitcoin in your Square Bitcoin wallet (zero processing or withdrawal fees)
  2. Automatically convert some or all of the Bitcoin into your Square USD wallet (with a 1% conversion fee)

This isn’t just about convenience — it’s about giving businesses direct, global, and instant payment freedom without middlemen.

Compass Coffee in DC became the first local business to roll out this new feature at one of their cafés. Members of the [Bitcoin District](https://bitcoindistrict.org) community stopped by to try it out — each using a different Bitcoin wallet to pay for coffee. Every transaction settled instantly.

## What Businesses Should Know

### **Zero Fees (Until 2027)**
As of this writing, Square is not charging any Bitcoin transaction fees until at least 2027. That means businesses can receive Bitcoin payments instantly without paying any processing fees—keeping more of what they earn.

### **Open Payments: Any Lightning Wallet Works**

The Lightning Network is a faster, low-cost layer built on top of Bitcoin that enables instant payments between anyone, anywhere.

Customers can pay from *any* Lightning wallet, not just Square’s. This open approach avoids vendor lock-in and keeps Bitcoin payments interoperable and free. Whether it’s Phoenix, Muun, Blink, or Breez — your customers can use the wallet they already trust.


### **Full Control Over Conversion**

Square’s Bitcoin tools give business owners complete control over how they manage their funds — right at the point of sale. Once Bitcoin payments are enabled, sellers can decide what happens next:

- **Hold Bitcoin:** Keep some or all of the Bitcoin received, adding it directly to the business’s Bitcoin balance.
- **Convert Bitcoin to Dollars:** Automatically convert incoming Bitcoin payments into dollars through Square’s point-of-sale system, with conversion handled instantly behind the scenes.   
- **Convert Dollars into Bitcoin:** Choose to automatically convert a portion of dollar sales into Bitcoin, building a stronger position over time.

Every business can set its own preferences — whether they simply want to accept Bitcoin as payment or begin saving in it gradually. Square handles the technical side so business owners can focus on serving their customers.

## Why This Matters for Local Businesses

Paying with Bitcoin isn’t new — but **how easy Square just made it is**.  

Now, any neighborhood business can turn on Bitcoin payments in minutes, directly inside the same Square app they already use for credit cards and cash. There’s no new hardware, no extra setup, and no disruption to existing systems. 

Businesses can now accept Bitcoin payments as easily as swiping a card — but with open, peer-to-peer settlement and no middlemen.  

For local merchants, this update means there’s finally an easy way to serve the growing Bitcoin community in Washington, DC. Groups like **Bitcoin District** — made up of everyday residents, small business owners, and local Bitcoiners — are eager to start spending their bitcoin at neighborhood cafés, shops, and especially at farmers markets across the city.  

A **Bitcoin circular economy** simply means keeping value local — where customers can earn, spend, and save using Bitcoin within their own community. Square’s integration brings that vision within reach by making it simple for any business to accept Bitcoin right alongside dollars.  

This is great news for us at the **Bitcoin District Initiative**, as it makes our goal of helping **100 DC businesses start accepting Bitcoin by 2026** very achievable.
