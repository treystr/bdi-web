The **Articles of Incorporation** are the foundational legal documents that formally established the **Bitcoin District Initiative** as a nonprofit corporation in Washington, DC. Filed with the District of Columbia, these Articles define our organizationâ€™s **legal existence, structure, and charitable purpose**.  

They serve as the starting point for everything we do, outlining:

* The official name of the organization  
* Our nonprofit and charitable purpose  
* Our eligibility for tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3)  
* Basic structural elements like the registered office and initial board  

Together with our [Bylaws](/docs/bylaws), Mission Statement, and IRS 1023-EZ filing, these Articles form the backbone of our governance and compliance as a public charity.

## Why This Matters
The Articles of Incorporation are more than just paperwork â€” they are the legal foundation that makes the Bitcoin District Initiative possible. By publishing them openly, we demonstrate our commitment to **transparency and accountability**, allowing anyone interested in our mission to see how we were originally established and what principles guide our existence as a nonprofit.
