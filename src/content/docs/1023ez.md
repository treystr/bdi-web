The IRS Form 1023-EZ is a streamlined application that smaller nonprofits like the Bitcoin District Initiative use to apply for recognition as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization. It outlines our mission, activities, governance, and operational details as submitted to and approved by the IRS. By sharing this publicly, we're committed to openness, allowing you to see firsthand how we're structured to provide accessible Bitcoin education and resources that promote personal sovereignty and community collaboration in Washington, DC and beyond. Note: This form is for informational purposes and reflects our application at the time of filing.
