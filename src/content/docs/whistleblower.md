## **Article 1: Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**

The Bitcoin District Initiative (hereinafter "the Corporation") is committed to lawful, ethical, and transparent conduct in all its operations. This Whistleblower Protection Policy encourages directors, officers, employees, volunteers, and other stakeholders to report suspected wrongdoing, ensures compliance with applicable laws—including the District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act (D.C. Code § 29-401 et seq.)—and protects individuals from retaliation. It affirms the Corporation’s commitment to a culture of accountability and integrity in support of its mission to advance Bitcoin education and personal sovereignty.

### **1.2 Scope**

This policy applies to all individuals associated with the Corporation, including board members, officers, staff, volunteers, and contractors. Reportable concerns include:

* Financial misconduct, fraud, or mismanagement of funds.  
* Violations of the Corporation’s policies or applicable federal, state, or local laws.  
* Unethical behavior, conflicts of interest, or abuse of authority.  
* Discrimination, harassment, or violations of employment laws.  
* Misuse of organizational resources or donor-restricted funds.  
* Conduct that jeopardizes the Corporation’s 501(c)(3) status.

## **Article 2: Reporting Procedures**

### **2.1 Duty to Report**

All Covered Persons (directors, officers, employees, and volunteers) must report suspected wrongdoing promptly and in good faith, based on a reasonable belief that misconduct has occurred.

### **2.2 Reporting Channels**

* **Primary Contact**: Submit reports to the Corporation’s Secretary by email or in writing at the Board-designated address.  
* **Alternate Contacts**: If the Secretary is implicated or unavailable, submit reports to the President or Treasurer.  
* **Anonymous Reporting**: Anonymous reports may be submitted in writing to the Corporation’s principal office or via a secure online form, if available, with sufficient detail for investigation.  
* **External Reporting**: If internal channels are ineffective, concerns may be reported to agencies like the IRS or DC Department of Licensing and Consumer Protection.

Reports should include the nature of the concern, relevant dates, names of involved individuals, specific conduct, and any supporting documentation.

## **Article 3: Whistleblower Protections**

Individuals reporting in good faith or participating in investigations shall not face retaliation, such as dismissal, demotion, harassment, or adverse changes in affiliation terms. Retaliators may face disciplinary action, including termination or removal from the board.

### **3.2 Confidentiality**

The Corporation will maintain confidentiality of the reporter’s identity and information, consistent with investigation needs and legal obligations.
