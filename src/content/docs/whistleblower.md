# Whistleblower Protection Policy  
**Bitcoin District Initiative**

## 1. Purpose  
The Bitcoin District Initiative (the "Corporation") is committed to lawful, ethical, and transparent conduct in all its operations. This Whistleblower Protection Policy is designed to encourage directors, officers, employees, volunteers, and other stakeholders to report suspected wrongdoing, ensure compliance with applicable laws—including the District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act—and protect individuals from retaliation. It affirms the Corporation’s commitment to a culture of accountability and integrity.

## 2. Scope  
This policy applies to all individuals associated with the Corporation, including but not limited to board members, officers, staff, volunteers, and contractors. Reportable concerns include:

- Financial misconduct, fraud, or mismanagement of funds.
- Violations of the Corporation’s policies, internal controls, or applicable federal, state, or local laws.
- Unethical behavior, conflicts of interest, or abuse of authority.
- Discrimination, harassment, or other violations of employment laws.
- Misuse of organizational resources or donor-restricted funds.
- Any conduct that jeopardizes the Corporation’s 501(c)(3) status.

## 3. Reporting Responsibilities and Procedures  

### 3.1. Affirmative Duty to Report  
All Covered Persons (directors, officers, employees, and volunteers) have a duty to report suspected wrongdoing promptly and in good faith, based on a reasonable belief that misconduct has occurred.  

### 3.2. Reporting Channels  
- **Primary Contact**: Reports should be submitted to the Corporation’s Secretary by email or in writing at the official address designated by the Board.  
- **Alternate Contacts**: If the Secretary is implicated, unavailable, or if the reporter is uncomfortable contacting them, reports may be submitted to the President or Treasurer.  
- **Anonymous Reporting**: Individuals may submit anonymous reports in writing to the Corporation’s principal office, or via a secure online form if available. Sufficient detail should be provided to allow investigation.  
- **External Reporting**: If internal channels are ineffective or inappropriate, concerns may be reported to government agencies, such as the IRS or the DC Department of Licensing and Consumer Protection.

### 3.3. Report Content  
Reports should, when possible, include the nature of the concern, relevant dates, names of involved individuals, specific conduct, and any supporting documentation or evidence.

## 4. No Retaliation  
No individual who in good faith reports a suspected violation or participates in an investigation shall suffer retaliation. Retaliation includes dismissal, demotion, harassment, or any adverse change in terms or conditions of affiliation with the Corporation. Retaliators may face disciplinary action, including termination, removal from the board, or legal action.

## 5. Investigation and Oversight  

### 5.1. Acknowledgment  
The designated officer shall acknowledge receipt of a report within five (5) business days unless the report is anonymous.  

### 5.2. Investigation  
Reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly, fairly, and confidentially. The investigation will be overseen by the Board of Directors or a designated committee, with legal counsel or external advisors engaged when appropriate.

### 5.3. Findings and Resolution  
Upon completion, the Board will determine any corrective actions or policy changes necessary and, where feasible, notify the whistleblower of the outcome, maintaining confidentiality as required by law.

### 5.4. Board Reporting  
The Board shall maintain oversight of whistleblower reports and investigations to ensure fair handling and resolution of all concerns.

## 6. Confidentiality  
To the extent possible, the Corporation will maintain the confidentiality of the reporter’s identity and the information shared, consistent with the need to conduct an effective investigation and comply with legal obligations.

## 7. Good Faith Requirement  
Reports must be made in good faith. Knowingly false or malicious reports may result in disciplinary action. Honest mistakes will not result in negative consequences for the reporter.

## 8. Documentation and Recordkeeping  
The Corporation shall maintain a confidential log of all whistleblower reports and outcomes in accordance with its document retention policy. Access will be limited to authorized individuals.

## 9. Distribution and Training  
This policy shall be distributed to all directors, officers, employees, and volunteers at the time of engagement and reviewed annually. It shall also be publicly posted on the Corporation’s website to support transparency and accountability.

## 10. Compliance and Indemnification  
This policy supports compliance with applicable federal and DC laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and DC’s duty of directors to report material legal violations. Individuals acting in good faith under this policy may be entitled to indemnification under the Corporation’s bylaws and applicable law.

## 11. Amendments  
This policy may be amended by a two-thirds vote of the Board of Directors at a regular or special meeting, with at least seven days’ advance notice of proposed changes.
