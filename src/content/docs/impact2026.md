The Bitcoin District Initiative will publish its **first annual Impact Report** in early **2027**, covering our activities and achievements throughout 2025.  

Each year moving forward, we will release an **Impact Report** to share our progress with supporters, community members, and the broader public. These reports will document how our programs, workshops, and outreach efforts are advancing our mission to build a thriving Bitcoin hub in Washington, DC.

## Why This Matters
Publishing an annual Impact Report is one of the ways we demonstrate accountability to our supporters and community. It shows the **positive impacts we're having at the local level**â€”from residents gaining confidence with Bitcoin, to local businesses learning self-custody, to new partnerships that strengthen grassroots adoption.  

For donors, volunteers, and future participants, the Impact Report offers a clear view of how contributions of time, energy, and resources translate into **real-world outcomes that empower people through Bitcoin education and community collaboration**.
