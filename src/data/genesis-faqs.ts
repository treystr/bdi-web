            question: "How do I become a Genesis Donor?",
            answer: "Donate 100,000 sats or more using our Zaprite payment link. After your donation is confirmed, we'll reach out to gather your preferred display informationâ€”whether you'd like to be recognized by name, nym, or remain anonymous."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I remain anonymous?",
            answer: "Yes! Recognition on this page is completely optional. You can choose to be listed anonymously, use a pseudonym (nym), or provide your real name. Your privacy is respected, and you control how you're recognized."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I edit or remove my listing later?",
            answer: "Absolutely. Contact us anytime at hey@bitcoindistrictinitiative.org to update your information, change your display name, modify your message, or request removal from the Genesis Donors page."
        },
        {
            question: "What will my donation support?",
            answer: "Your Genesis donation helps fund the foundational work of the Bitcoin District Initiative: hosting educational workshops, onboarding local businesses to accept Bitcoin, printing educational materials, attending community markets and events, and developing open-source resources. You're helping build DC's Bitcoin circular economy from the ground up."
