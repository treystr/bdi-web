# Astro Theme Rules

## Project Overview
This project uses the Titan Core Astro theme, which provides a set of pre-built components and layouts. The project structure is as follows:
- `public/`: Static assets (e.g., favicon.ico)
- `src/`: 
  - `assets/`: Additional assets
  - `components/`: 
    - `blog/`: Blog-related components (e.g., Post cards, category pills)
    - `forms/`: Form components
    - `icons/`: Icon components
    - `sections/`: Layout section components (e.g., Hero, Features, Split Panel, CTA Banner)
    - `team/`: Team-related components (e.g., Team grid, member cards)
    - `ui/`: UI components (e.g., Buttons, Forms, Cards)
  - `content/`: Content files (e.g., blog posts, pages)
  - `data/`: Configuration data (e.g., config.ts, menu.ts, features.ts)
  - `layouts/`: Layout components (e.g., Layout.astro)
  - `pages/`: Page components (e.g., index.astro, about.astro)
  - `styles/`: Global styles
  - `utils/`: Utility functions

## Component Usage
- Always use existing components from `src/components/` when possible.
- For layout sections, use components from `src/components/sections/`, such as:
  - Hero
  - Features
  - Split Panel
  - CTA Banner
  - etc.
- For UI elements, use components from `src/components/ui/`, such as:
  - Buttons
  - Forms
  - Cards
  - etc.
- For blog-related content, use components from `src/components/blog/`.
- For team-related content, use components from `src/components/team/`.
- Before creating a new component, check if an existing one can be reused or extended.

## Styling
- The theme provides 10 pre-configured themes (e.g., zeus, poseidon). The current theme is set in `src/data/config.ts` via `themeSetting`.
- Use the theme's CSS classes and variables for styling.
- Avoid hardcoding styles; instead, use the theme's provided classes.
- If the theme switcher is not needed, remove it by editing `src/layouts/Layout.astro` (remove `ThemeSwitcher` import and component).

## Design Layout Inspiration
- When designing new components to display content across teh site, use this website for inspiration: https://www.charitywater.org/
- Adhere to Astro best practices and the styling (colors, etc) established in the current theme, but when designing the layouts for beautiful content, reference this site for inspiration.
- We want to make sure businesses that land at our website are greeted with a beautiful view of what our nonprofit is doing in the community.

## Page Creation
- When creating new pages, look at existing pages in `src/pages/` to understand the structure and component usage.
- Use the Layout components appropriately (e.g., wrap pages with `Layout.astro`).
- Ensure new pages follow the same patterns as existing ones for consistency.

## Configuration
- Content and configuration are managed in `src/data/` and `src/content/`.
- When adding new content, update the relevant files in `src/data/`, such as:
  - `menu.ts`: For navigation menu
  - `features.ts`: For feature sections
  - `faqs.ts`: For FAQ sections
  - `logos.ts`: For logos
  - `categories.ts`: For blog categories
- Use Astro's content collections for managing content in `src/content/`.

## Best Practices
- Follow Astro's best practices for component composition and routing.
- Keep components reusable and avoid one-off implementations.
- Use Astro's features like islands and hydration appropriately.
- Write new components in `.astro` format unless a specific framework (e.g., React, Vue) is required.
- Use TypeScript for enhanced type safety where applicable.

## Cursor-Specific Instructions
- Always check for existing components in `src/components/` before creating new ones.
- Reference existing pages in `src/pages/` when creating new pages.
- Use the theme's styling system for consistent design.
- Avoid introducing custom styles or components unless absolutely necessary.
- When adding new content, ensure to update the corresponding configuration files in `src/data/`.

## Additional Notes
- This project uses Astro, a modern web framework that supports partial hydration and multi-framework integration.
- Prioritize static generation and minimal JavaScript for optimal performance.
- Use descriptive variable names and follow Astro's naming conventions.
- Organize files using Astro's file-based routing system.
